    <h1> About Carlos</h1>
    <p>Carlos is an aspiring computer nerd. He has never been able to reach top nerd status, but
    he hope's this can change very soon.  His father always told him he was born in a barn but
    no one has ever been able to corroborate that story.  Fast-forward to later in life, Carlos decided
    to make a name for himself and get some real school learning.  Carlos enrolled at UNM to mainly get
    away from both of his parents and become a traveling carney.  He decided against that and got a degree in
    finance from the Anderson School of Management.  Fortunately for Carlos, He graduated at the height
    of the great recession and his dreams of a life on wallstreet were dashed.  This led him to find a fairly
    lucrative job selling enterprise level hardware and software but that corporate life was brutal.  He eventually
    went out on his own to start his own consulting firm.  After about a year he had another opportunity to go
    in business with his family which in retrospect was a very interesting learning experience.  Carlos is currently
    excited to be learning full-stack web development and is ready to bring this tech into his own business and beyond </p>
